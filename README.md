procedurally generated socio-genetic simulation

MVP

Version 1

```
as an observer
because I am interested in life simulations
i want to see a basic cell

as an observer
so that there is variation in cells
i want to see two different cells

as an observer
so the cells seem more realistic as living creatures
i want to see them move

as an observer 
so that the cells can interact
i want an event to occur when they collide

as an observer
so that more cells can be created
i want the cells to create another cell on collision

as an observer
so that the new cells are genetic offspring
the new cell will have attributes that are a mix of the parent attributes
